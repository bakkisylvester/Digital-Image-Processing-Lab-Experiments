# Digital-Image-Processing-Lab-Practicals




This repository hosts all MATLAB scripts, images, and results for the **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** laboratory sessions conducted as part of the academic curriculum, under the guidance of **Dr. Tapan Jain**.  
Each folder corresponds to a specific practical and follows a consistent, organized structure for ease of use and navigation.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure (Per Practical)

Each practical is stored in its own folder named `Practical_X/` (e.g., `Practical_1`, `Practical_2`, etc.) and follows the structure below:

```text
Practical_X/
â”œâ”€â”€ Input_Image/      # Contains original input images
â”œâ”€â”€ Matlab_Code/      # Contains MATLAB scripts for that practical
â”œâ”€â”€ Output/           # Contains output images generated by the code
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Description of that specific practical

```
