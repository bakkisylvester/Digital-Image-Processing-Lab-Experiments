# Practical 2: 

This experiment demonstrates the processing of a grayscale image using MATLAB. It includes:

-Performing bit-plane slicing to separate and display individual bit planes of the image.
Observing the contribution of each bit plane to the overall image.

-Applying histogram equalization to enhance the contrast of the image.
